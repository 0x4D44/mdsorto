## Overview

MDSORTO (MD Standup Ordering Randomization Tool) was created by **mdavidson** in November 2023 to help teams conduct standup meetings more effectively. It takes a list of participants, shuffles their order, and assigns each person a fixed amount of time to speak. During each speakerâ€™s turn, the timer counts down and changes color as the allotted time diminishes, alerting the speaker when their time is almost up.
